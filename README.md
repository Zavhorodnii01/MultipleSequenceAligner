# MSA - Multiple Sequence Alignment (Center Star Method)

This project implements the Center Star method for Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) as part of the Introduction to Bioinformatics course at Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology.

## Overview

This Python program performs MSA using the Center Star algorithm. It provides flexible input options, customizable scoring schemes, and a graphical representation of the optimal alignment.  The results, including alignment statistics, can be saved to a file.  The program features an interactive user GUI for ease of use.

## Features

* **Sequence Input:**
    * Manual input
    * FASTA file import
* **Customizable Scoring:**  Adjust match scores, mismatch penalties, and gap penalties.
* **Optimal Alignment Generation:**
    * Graphical display of the alignment with parameters and scoring information.
    * Output saving to a file (similar format to Task #2).
* **Alignment Statistics:**
    * Identity percentage
    * Number of matches, mismatches, and gaps
* **Interactive GUI:** User-friendly interface for streamlined execution.

## Algorithm

The Center Star method works by:

1. **Finding the center sequence:** The sequence with the minimum sum of distances to all other sequences is selected as the center.
2. **Progressive alignment:**  Remaining sequences are progressively aligned to the center sequence using pairwise alignment techniques.  The resulting alignments form the initial MSA.
3. **Refinement (optional):** Iterative refinement methods can be used to improve the alignment score.
